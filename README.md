## IMDB_Weighted_Rating_Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing IMDB ratings using Python to calculate weighted scores and uncover insights about movies.

## Project Overview

This project utilizes the IMDB dataset to explore:

Weighted rating calculations based on IMDB's formula. Statistical insights derived from ratings.

## Key Objectives

Calculate weighted ratings for movies. Understand the distribution of ratings. Identify top-performing movies based on adjusted scores.

## Tools and Libraries

Programming Language: Python

## Libraries Used:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis. math: For mathematical computations. scipy.stats: For statistical analysis.

## Methodology

Data Preparation:

Import and clean the IMDB dataset. Set display options for efficient data exploration. Weighted Rating Calculation:

Apply IMDB's weighted rating formula:

Where:

: Average rating of the movie

: Number of votes for the movie

: Minimum votes required to be listed in the top ranked

: The mean vote across the dataset

## Analysis and Insights:

Analyze rating distributions. Highlight top movies based on weighted scores.

## Results

Identified movies with the highest weighted ratings. Insights into rating patterns and their implications.

## How to Use

Clone this repository. Install the required Python libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt. Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook to reproduce the analysis.

Enjoy diving into the data and discovering what makes a movie stand out! 🎥✨
